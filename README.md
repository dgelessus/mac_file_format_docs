## Inside Macintosh

The Inside Macintosh book series are Apple's official reference material for the classic Macintosh platform. Over time, they have gone through many revisions and updates, and their structure has been changed multiple times.

The Gryphel project (best known for the Mini vMac emulator) has [a list of physical book releases](https://www.gryphel.com/c/books/appledev.html) of Inside Macintosh (and other Apple developer documentation), including ISBNs, publishers, dates, and Amazon links.

The following is a (likely incomplete) list of the major revisions of Inside Macintosh and where they can be obtained online.

* The earliest revisions consisted of two volumes, each a three-ring binder containing photocopied pages. The chapters were referred to as individual "manuals" and were essentially standalone - each one had its own title page, TOC, glossary, and page numbers. Various parts were still missing or not yet finalized, and updated pages were distributed regularly as part of the [Macintosh Software Supplement](https://macgui.com/news/article.php?t=447).

	* bitsavers.org has scanned and OCRed PDFs of a late (November 1984) revision: [Volume I](http://bitsavers.org/pdf/apple/mac/Inside_Macintosh_Vol_1_1984.pdf), [Volume II](http://bitsavers.org/pdf/apple/mac/Inside_Macintosh_Vol_2_1984.pdf).

* The Promotional Edition, released in early 1985, consisted of a single book (it was nicknamed the "phonebook" edition because of its paper quality). Although it was physically a single book, the contents were still structured into standalone "manuals" like in the ring binder version, and some parts were still missing or not finalized.

	* bitsavers.org has [a scanned and OCRed PDF](http://bitsavers.org/pdf/apple/mac/Inside_Macintosh_Promotional_Edition_1985.pdf).

* The published 1985 revision consisted of three volumes, available as three paperback books or a single hardcover book. They contained the finalized contents of the previous revisions, which documented the Macintosh 128k, Macintosh 512k, and Macintosh XL. Unlike the previous revisions, each volume had continuous page numbers and a full TOC and index, and volume III contained a complete glossary.

	* pagetable.com has a [blog post](http://www.pagetable.com/?p=50) with [a scanned and OCRed PDF of the three paperback volumes](http://www.weihenstephan.org/~michaste/pagetable/mac/Inside_Macintosh.pdf).

* Additional volumes were published later to document newer Macintosh models. These served as incremental additions and did not fully supersede or replace any of the previous volumes.

	* Volume IV was published in 1986 and documented the Macintosh Plus and Macintosh 512k Enhanced.
	* Volume V was published in 1986 and documented the Macintosh II and Macintosh SE.
	* Volume VI was published in 1991 and documented System 7.0.
	* VintageApple.org has [scanned and OCRed PDFs of Volumes I through VI](https://vintageapple.org/inside_o/).

* After 1991, Inside Macintosh was restructured into over 20 volumes organized by topic, rather than chronologically by Macintosh model. These were published as books starting in 1992, and later also on CDs and online.

	* VintageApple.org has [rendered (not scanned) PDFs of 26 volumes and 7 X-Ref volumes](https://vintageapple.org/inside_r/).
	
		* The Communications Toolbox and QuickDraw GX Programmers' Overview volumes appear to be missing.
	
	* Many volumes are still available in Apple's legacy developer documentation archive, in HTML and rendered (not scanned) PDF formats:
	
		* Two volumes appear on the website under Inside Macintosh, even though other sources don't consider them part of the Inside Macintosh series:

## Resource forks

* The chapter "Resource Manager" in the [Inside Macintosh](#inside-macintosh) series. This chapter is found in Volume I of the original Inside Macintosh revisions, and in the "More Macintosh Toolbox" volume of the restructured revisions.
* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_fork), of course.
* The [Resource Fork](http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/Resource_Fork) article on "Just Solve the File Format Problem" (despite the title, this is a decent site and not clickbait).
* The [KSFL](https://github.com/kreativekorp/ksfl) library (and [its wiki](https://github.com/kreativekorp/ksfl/wiki/Macintosh-Resource-File-Format)), written in Java, which supports reading and writing resource files.
* Alysis Software Corporation's article on resource compression (found on [the company's website](http://www.alysis.us/arctechnology.htm) and in [MacTech Magazine's online archive](http://preserve.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.09/09.01/ResCompression/index.html)) has some information on the structure of certain kinds of compressed resources.
* Apple's macOS SDK, which is distributed with Xcode. The latest version of Xcode is available for free from the Mac App Store. Current and previous versions can be downloaded from [the Apple Developer download page](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/). Accessing these downloads requires an Apple ID with (at least) a free developer program membership.
* Apple's MPW (Macintosh Programmer's Workshop) and related developer tools. These were previously available from Apple's FTP server at ftp://ftp.apple.com/, which is no longer functional. Because of this, these downloads are only available on mirror sites, such as http://staticky.com/mirrors/ftp.apple.com/.
